Fly..
You fools
Said Gandalf, as..
He fell into darkness.
Seeing this, the company
Stared in shock and grief.

Onto Lathlorien did they go
As fast as they could run.
Caught in a snare,
Elves always there,
But Aragon lead them on.

And Golum always after
Sneaky, sneaky..
Preacious is escaping,
We must look after nasty hobitses!
